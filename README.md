Fried rice has been a kitchen staple since as early as the Sui Dynasty (589â€“618 CE) in China. The primary reason for the continued popularity and ubiquity of this dish comes down to two things: its adaptability and the fact that people almost always cook too much rice. 

Fried rice is a quick and delicious way to transform leftovers into something delicious! Though we sometimes think of certain ingredients being typical (eggs, garlic, soy) the only thing you need to make fried rice is heat, rice, and oil. Anything else you add is up to you.
