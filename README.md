Fried rice has been a kitchen staple since as early as the Sui Dynasty (589â€“618 CE) in China. The primary reason for the continued popularity and ubiquity of this dish comes down to two things: its adaptability and the fact that people almost always cook too much rice. 

Fried rice is a quick and delicious way to transform leftovers into something delicious!
